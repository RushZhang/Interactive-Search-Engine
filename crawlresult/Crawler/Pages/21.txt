mockingbird part 3
suddenly, scout and jem have to tolerate a barrage of racial slurs and insults because of atticus' role in the trial. during this time, scout has a very difficult time restraining from physically fighting with other children, a tendency that gets her in trouble with her aunt alexandra and uncle jack. even jem, the older and more levelheaded of the two, loses his temper a time or two. after responding to a neighbor's (mrs. dubose) verbal attack by destroying her plants, jem is sentenced to read to her every day after school for one month. ultimately, scout and jem learn a powerful lesson about bravery from this woman. as the trial draws nearer, aunt alexandra comes to live with them under the guise of providing a feminine influence for scout.
