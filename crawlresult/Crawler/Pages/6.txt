mockingbird part 5
atticus does not want jem and scout to be present at tom robinson's trial. no seat is available on the main floor, so by invitation of rev. sykes, jem, scout, and dill watch from the colored balcony. atticus establishes that the accusers—mayella and her father, bob ewell, the town drunk—are lying. it also becomes clear that the friendless mayella made sexual advances toward tom, and that her father caught her and beat her. despite significant evidence of tom's innocence, the jury convicts him. jem's faith in justice becomes badly shaken, as is atticus', when the hapless tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.

despite tom's conviction, bob ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial, atticus explaining that he "destroyed [ewell's] last shred of credibility at that trial."[11] ewell vows revenge, spitting in atticus' face, trying to break into the judge's house, and menacing tom robinson's widow. finally, he attacks the defenseless jem and scout while they walk home on a dark night after the school halloween pageant. one of jem's arms is broken in the struggle, but amid the confusion someone comes to the children's rescue. the mysterious man carries jem home, where scout realizes that he is boo radley.

sheriff tate arrives and discovers that bob ewell has died during the fight. the sheriff argues with atticus about the prudence and ethics of charging jem (whom atticus believes to be responsible) or boo (whom tate believes to be responsible). atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that ewell simply fell on his own knife. boo asks scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at his front door he disappears again. while standing on the radley porch, scout imagines life from boo's perspective, and regrets that they had never repaid him for the gifts he had given them.
