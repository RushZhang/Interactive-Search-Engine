mockingbird part 4
the story takes place during three years (1933â€“35) of the great depression in the fictional "tired old town" of maycomb, alabama, the seat of maycomb county. it focuses on six-year-old jean louise finch (scout), who lives with her older brother, jem, and their widowed father, atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. jem and scout befriend a boy named dill, who visits maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. the three children are terrified of, and fascinated by, their neighbor, the reclusive arthur "boo" radley. the adults of maycomb are hesitant to talk about boo, and, for many years few have seen him. the children feed one another's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. after two summers of friendship with dill, scout and jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the radley place. several times the mysterious boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.

judge taylor appoints atticus to defend tom robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, mayella ewell. although many of maycomb's citizens disapprove, atticus agrees to defend tom to the best of his ability. other children taunt jem and scout for atticus's actions, calling him a "nigger-lover". scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching tom. this danger is averted when scout, jem, and dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from atticus' and tom's points of view.
