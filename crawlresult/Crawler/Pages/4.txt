mockingbird part 2
the only neighbor who puzzles them is the mysterious arthur radley, nicknamed boo, who never comes outside. when dill, another neighbor's nephew, starts spending summers in maycomb, the three children begin an obsessive — and sometimes perilous — quest to lure boo outside.  scout is a tomboy who prefers the company of boys and generally solves her differences with her fists. she tries to make sense of a world that demands that she act like a lady, a brother who criticizes her for acting like a girl, and a father who accepts her just as she is. scout hates school, gaining her most valuable education on her own street and from her father. not quite midway through the story, scout and jem discover that their father is going to represent a black man named tom robinson, who is accused of raping and beating a white woman.
